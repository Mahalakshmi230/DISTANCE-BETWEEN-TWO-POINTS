# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance between two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import math
### Step 2:
Initialize the two values
### Step 3:

import math 
l1 = [4,2]
l2 = [10,6]
d = math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(d))
```

### OUTPUT:
